/* The following set of Contexts (TestFixture) are in place to specify the functionality that you need to complete for the MovieLibrary class.
 * MovieLibrary is an aggregate root for the Movie class. It exposes the ability to search,sort, and iterate over all of the movies that it aggregates.
 * The current implementation of MovieLibrary has all of its methods throwing a NotImplementedException. Your job is to get all of the Contexts and their
 it should already have so = () =>
 * familiarity with:
 * 
 *      -IEnumerable<T> - The Grandfather of all collection interfaces
 *      -IList<T>
 *      -IEquatable<T>
 *      -IComparer<T>
 *      -Comparison<T> delegate type
 *      -Predicate<T> delegate type
 *      -Generics     
 * 
 * The primary goals of this exercise are to get you familiar with a couple of things:
 *      Automated Builds with powershell
 *      Unit Testing Framework (MbUnit)
 *      BDD Style Test Naming Syntax
 *      Fluent Assertions - You will find most of these are extension methods that live in the BDDExtensions class
 *      Refactoring
 *      Core collection and framework interfaces and types
 *      Encapsulation
 *      Open Closed Principle
 *      Coding to Specs (Tests)
 *      
 *
 * As I said earlier, the tests are complete. You will just need to get the implementation working. As you progress through the exercise you will undoubtebly see areas
 * where refactoring can take place (particularly around the area of methods that don't need to be there on MovieLibrary. This is as much a design exercise as it is
 * an implementation exercise. Do your best to refactor what you end up with to the best of your abilities.
 * 
 * One other stipulation of this exercise is that Linq is not to be used!! We will explore linq options together as we go through completed solutions
 * on the first day of class. I want you to use this opportunity to see how Linq like you can get your solution in spite of not being able to use linq
 * , this just gives you another reason to flex you .net muscles!!
 * 
 * If you have any questions please do not hesitate to email me at jp@jpboodhoo.com
 * Or give me a call at (503)213-3507
 * 
 * Develop With Passion!!

Before you try to run any of the build tasks (only test and deploy are really applicable for this project) make sure
you have powershell installed and it is in your path.


*****All build activities are to be done with a command prompt that is pointing at this build folder******

To Test: build test

To Deploy: build deploy_assembly (output will go to the build\deploy folder)

To Open The Solutions: open (you don't have to use this, but if you do it will ensure that the TestDriven.Net runner uses the version
                             of MBUnit that lives in this project).
